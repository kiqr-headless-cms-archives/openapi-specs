OpenAPI specifications for KIQR.CLOUD
-------------------------------------
This repository hosts our latest official OpenAPI specifications for all available KIQR.CLOUD api's:

- Core API - [yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiqr/openapi-specs/main/core-api.yaml) / [docs](https://kiqr.dev/docs/apis/core-api/)

The main branch is **automatically updated** every patch/release of an API and can therefore be considered the source of truth. 

## Code generators
We are using an OpenAPI generator along with these OAS yaml files to generate our new SDKs.

## Contributing
If you find something missing or incorrect please [open an issue](https://github.com/kiqr/openapi-specs/issues/new) or send us a pull request. Don't manually push changes in OAS files directly to this repository.
